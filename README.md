# Lynn Toolkit
Meta-visualization of TE-data across a genome toolkit

### Objective
Transposable Elements are dispersed across the genome. This tool takes genome-wide
data (bigwig, .bw), or annotations (.gtf) and re-maps it to a theoretical 'consensus'
element.

Further for Trancsriptome assemblies/annotations in GTF it should be possible to plot
functional transcript start-site, splice donor, splice acceptor, terminator signals
to the consensus elements to look for common usage.

Ideally this will also generate usable dataframes in R which could allow for easy
comparisons between data-sets and so forth.
